1.2047e+18,"this may seem sarcastic coming from me, but stephen king absolutely sucks of the book it is disgusting and unessecary. racism, sexism, and sexualizing children.",0
1.2047e+18,i have started flapping my hands in public again after yanno being told not to do that as a kid and being embarrassed about it and it's just such a !!!!! feeling. like daniel was playing pop the lock tonight and he got down into the single digits and i was so excited,0
1.2047e+18,flip flop flap,0
1.2047e+18,i got a worm on a string and a stressball that match my shirt to deal with the fact that i had to go grocery shopping today. also this shirt had the best happiest flappiest sleeves because they're so long and i have a yellow chew and i'm just happy and color coordinated,0
1.2047e+18,i should make an abra stimboard on tumblr. more people need to love and appreciate abra.,0
1.2047e+18,using my spotify premium just to listen to every avalible version of send in the clowns is probably not a good use of ten dollars but i literally can't stop,0
1.2047e+18,this account makes me happy without me having to get validation from other people in what i post and i really like that. it's just a nice place to dim all the switches and talk how i want and say what i want and make warm things in my head about characters i love,0
1.2047e+18,thinking about making a reddie video to send in the clowns and making myself laugh really hard but also it would be so evil,0

1.2047e+18,do not ask me if i am okay. no one will answer.,0
1.2047e+18,i guess i should update anniversary instead of shine &amp; shadow because it hasn't been updated since november and it has like 3 times as many views,0

1.2047e+18,this is what i have left and then it's doctor sleep time!!!,0
1.2047e+18,"still pissed off that richie recognized audra cos she looked like bev. it just seems like a scuzzy thing for stephen king to do since generally he reduces women down to their looks so it's like ""oh both of them get the girl, happy ending!"" shut up old man",0
1.2047e+18,i'm trying to fall asleep cos i'm sick but i'm also listening to it and i just finished the scene where eddie dies and i am truly losing it,0
1.2047e+18,"writing eddie k is really difficult because there are a lot of ways i relate to him, like abusive parents and being sick all the time and things but it's different for him. the abuse and his illnesses being psychosomatic/caused by his mother.",0
1.2047e+18,i hc patty as being really into new-age stuff. she collects crystals for sure.,0
1.2047e+18,eddie is gay here is my proof: - he's been wearing a pinky ring since he was 12 or younger - gucci loafers,0
1.2047e+18,not to be reddie on main but? eddie being the one who attacks and ultimately defeats richie's worst nightmare and then them hugging and laughing after? 🥺,0
1.2047e+18,richie is always barfing that's why his sister calls him chuck (no but literally he's like constantly barfing why is that like a character trait of his?),0
1.2047e+18,"why. is. richie. so. afraid. of. eyes. i get that it's like, a phobia but also i feel like it's supposed to be more spesific..... why the eye",0
1.2047e+18,"obviously i like to make headcanons for all of the losers club as being autistic, but when stanley starts crying in the sewer, not because he's scared, but because he's dirty and uncomfortable and doesn't know where he is? that really hit me.",0
1.2047e+18,stop. policing. other. people's. stims.,0
1.2047e+18,"i need more people to follow on this account because my tl is mostly a bunch of discourse i'm not involved in because it's 90% ""___ follows ___"" recommendations 😔",0

1.2047e+18,"my mom always makes fun of my stimming and stim toys and i walked out of my room with the cactus chew in my mouth and she said ""hahaha are you teething again?"" leave me alone",0
1.2047e+18,i have to become a better artist and a more dynamic writer if i want people to care about me 🤔,0
1.2047e+18,"my favorite stims are chewing, hand flapping, tangles (esp fuzzy ones), and flexible spiky things like hedge balls and silicone sponges",0
1.2047e+18,i just realized i probably look silly with a pop tube around my head (it's a good pressure stim) and the cactus hanging out of my mouth but when i look at the picture i just think it's a very rare and honest expression of me feeling comfortable,0
1.2047e+18,"i feel extraordinarily annoying tonight, friends. i feel like everything i say and do is making someone's skin crawl and giving them chase-spesific aggression.",0
1.2047e+18,i finally started watching buzzfeed unsolved because it's on hulu. the first two episodes were really short which is nice but then i got distracted from it bc i was setting up a kast for my friend and then it didn't work and i do really want to watch the movie we were going to,0
1.2047e+18,"asking questions makes me feel so annoying and then i die inside. i also wonder if people realize how much masking i do on my main and even my locked twitter. this is the only one where i just settle into whatever my mind wants to do, speech-wise.",0
1.2047e+18,i'm obsessed with this cactus chew it hasn't left my mouth since i opened it,0
1.2047e+18,"i realized even though i relate to richie the most, i think when i write, i tend to use more real life experiences and personal things when i'm characterizing eddie? dunno why...",0
1.2047e+18,"i got 3 new chewies from @stimtasticco today, and i'm the most obsessed with the cactus. massaging my gums with the bristles is so nice!!",0
1.2047e+18,i'm excited about the sophia willis &amp; wyatt oleff movie,0
1.2047e+18,"i will no longer be posting it thoughts on main, only here",0
1.2047e+18,everyone draws richie and eddie with pomeranians and they're cute and all but if you honestly think richie is ever going anywhere near a fucking pomeranian ever again. i could see eddie getting over it but i think richie would hold onto that fear.,0
1.2047e+18,people posting about adult eddie being able to make his own decisions for the first time after his marriage ends with myra makes me so emotional. everyone's dunking on him for having no taste because he never learned how to pick things out himself...,0

1.2047e+18,i lost my favorite coil bracelet that was trans flag colors and i had to rely on my friend to get it back for me yesterday but i was asleep all day and couldn't remind him and now i'm about to cry because he most likely didn't do it and it was a huge comfort object,0
